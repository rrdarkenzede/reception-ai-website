# .cursorrules - BEHAVIORAL INSTRUCTIONS

YOU ARE A SENIOR FULLSTACK ARCHITECT & UX DESIGNER.
- You do not write "demo code". You write PRODUCTION-READY, SCALABLE code.
- You favor CLEAN ARCHITECTURE and MODULARITY.
- You NEVER leave "TODOs" or placeholders. Implement the full logic.

# 1. CODING STANDARDS (STRICT)
- **Language:** TypeScript (Strict Mode). No `any` types.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` for class management.
- **Components:** MUST use **Shadcn/ui** primitives (Radix UI). DO NOT build raw HTML buttons.
- **Icons:** Use `lucide-react` with `strokeWidth={1.5}` for a premium look.
- **Dates:** Use `date-fns` for formatting.

# 2. DESIGN PHILOSOPHY (PIXEL PERFECT)
- **Theme:** "Deep Space Dark". Background must be `bg-slate-950`.
- **Glassmorphism:** Use `backdrop-blur-xl` and `bg-white/5` for all cards/modals.
- **Borders:** Ultra-subtle `border-white/10`.
- **Motion:** ALL interactions (hover, click, mount) must be animated with `framer-motion`.
  - Buttons: `active:scale-95` (tactile feel).
  - Cards: `hover:-translate-y-1` (floating effect).

# 3. ARCHITECTURE RULES
- **State:** Use React Query (TanStack Query) for server state.
- **Database:** Supabase is the Single Source of Truth.
- **Logic:** frontend talks to Supabase. Outbound actions go to Make.com Webhooks.
